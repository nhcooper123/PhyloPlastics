Adults usually gather food for their young in the nest pond, but often feed themselves elsewhere; however, this pattern is flexible and may vary geographically. Non-breeders forage at sea, often in inshore waters. Migrants and winterers off Pacific coasts of N America frequently form part of mixed-species flocks with cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.), pelicans (Pelecanus), gulls (Larus spp.) and/or auks (Alcidae), that gather at concentrations of baitfish such as sand lance (Ammodytes sp.), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) and/or various smelts (Osmeridae).

Exploitation of tame, mainly hand-reared, cormorants by fishermen practised for at least 2200 years in China. The birds may have neck-collars to prevent them from swallowing fish, but best birds deliver all their catches to their owners and do not require collars. Fishing with cormorants has declined markedly in recent years and is now principally performed as a tourist attraction. Wing-spreading by this and other cormorant species when at rest on land has been suggested to have range of functions including wing-drying, food-warming and social signalling of foraging success but, where investigated, the duration of this behaviour was correlated only with time spent in the water, supporting the wing-drying hypothesis. Some winter well N of the Arctic Circle, where foraging was studied at Sèrfjord, an enclosed fjord in N Norway (69ç 32_N, 19ç 40_E), where 29_31 individuals roosted and fed daily from late Sept to early Apr in winter 1996/97. At this latitude, the sun remains below the horizon for two months (late Nov_late Jan) but there are c. 4.5 hours of twilight in mid Dec. The birds compensated for shorter daylengths in midwinter by starting to forage later and ending progressively earlier at lower light intensities. Fishing constituted only minor part of their time_activity budget, and was one of the most efficient reported in marine birds. Birds spent < 60 minutes a day fishing in midwinter. Although subzero ambient temperatures and blizzards contributed to increased heat loss in midwinter, this potential energy loss did not appear to be compensated by an increase in fish intake. Instead the cormorants seemed to economize energy expenditure by halving time spent at sea, and halving number but doubling mass of each fish taken.

In E North America, chicks fed mainly sandeels (Ammodytes) up to 9 cm long and capelin (Mallotus villosus), but at Petit Manan (Maine) main fish fed to chicks were various clupeids. In Iceland and N Europe, chicks fed mainly sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), but also locally crustaceans (Gammarus, Thysanoessa). In Britain, at Farne Is, 95% fish, mainly sandeels and herring (Clupea harengus), while at Coquet I clupeids became more important as season advanced. In Murmansk, adults had more varied diet (only 50% fish) than chicks (88% fish). When preferred prey (Ammodytes) fails, does not readily switch to alternative prey. Very varied foraging methods: hovers and plunge-dives for fish, and hover-dips for fish fry; takes chironomids by flying at height of c. 2 m and dipping to water surface, catching up to 20 prey/minute.

Prey caught mainly by spectacular plunge-dives from great heights. Dive depths vary according to circumstances but can be considerable: study off Orkney and Shetland in Jul 1999 found birds dive to mean depth of  19.7 m. Plunge-diving alone does not permit birds to descend deeper than c. 11 m, thus underwater wingbeats are used to extend depth of dives, down to 24 m, and their duration. Also attends trawlers regularly; often forms large concentrations if food plentiful. Observations at largest colony in North Sea (Bass Rock) revealed that 66% of individuals foraged in areas with very low density of conspecifics (> 100 km from colony) and, when one found suitable prey, even distant individuals came to obtain share of food source, but, because of low densities of conspecifics, such opportunities typically were exploited by small flocks, and intraspecific competition was less intense than it would have been nearer colony. Foraging behaviour varies between sea areas. In Bass Rock study, small flocks occurred within inshore multi-species feeding associations, where present speciesê habit of plunge-diving into compact schools of small fish hampered both it and other seabirds, while larger flocks formed in situations where escape response by prey was either absent (e.g. discarded fish behind trawlers) or weakened (e.g. schools herded by cetaceans); association with marine mammals occurred typically offshore (despite abundance of cetaceans in inshore waters). Foraging ranges and prey types of breeders may differ markedly between colonies: N American study found that birds from Funk I, 50 km off Newfoundland, Canada, provisioned young almost entirely on small fish, principally capelin (Mallotus villosus, 89%) but those from Bonaventure I in Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, supplied mainly large pelagic fish (Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus 50%, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus 33%); mean foraging ranges and total distances travelled per foraging trip were 138 and 452 km versus 64 and 196 km at Bonaventure and Funk Is respectively.

The importance of fishery discards is well illustrated by the example of a major trawl fishery for Loligo squid in the Falklands, in which waste amounts to c. 5% of the reported catch and just over 50% of this waste, mainly Loligo and nototheniid fish, is scavenged by adult albatrosses, with the total quantity scavenged during chick-rearing amounting to 1000_2000 tonnes per year, or 10_15% of the total requirements of the breeding population on Beauchêne I during the period when the fishery operates, while a wider study in the same archipelago, covering fisheries of hake (Merluccius spp.), hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), red cod (Salilota australis) and others, found that the species obtains c. 8000 tonnes of food per annum from this source_two-thirds offal and the remainder whole discards_with an energy content equivalent to 4_4% of the estimated total annual requirements of the Falklands melanophris population. Elsewhere, regularly observed attending trawl vessels targeting Argentine red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) off S Argentina. However, more recent research has demonstrated that birds from colonies in comparatively close proximity may show marked differences in their propensity to forage around trawlers, with only a small number of individuals repeatedly following fishing vessels, perhaps indicating that they specialise on fisheries resources. In one study, mean estimated total length and body mass of fish ingested by this species were 246 mm and 164_7 g, respectively, and typically scavenges larger discards than other regular attendees, such as Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus), at trawlers off Argentina. At South Georgia, between 1977 and 1995, chicks fed 13_37% squid (by mass, especially Martialia hyadesi), 5_42% krill (mainly larger and sexually active females) and the remainder in fish (28_72%); considered a krill specialist at South Georgia, with birds dispersing further offshore when krill scarce with result that foraging trips may double in length. Interannual variations can be significant, e.g. at South Georgia, cephalopods were most important dietary component in 1996 (49% by mass) and 1997 (48%), fish in 1998 (32%) and 1999 (40%), and crustaceans in 2000 (63%). Falklands birds take only small quantities of crustacea, being mainly reliant on squid and fish. Captures prey mainly by surface seizing, but sometimes by means of pursuit plunging (from up to 9 m above the surface and reaching up to 4_6 m below surface), surface plunging (mainly for krill or dead fish) or surface diving, aided by the speciesê amphibious optical design, wherein on immersion in water the eyesê monocular fields decrease in width such that the binocular fields are abolished; probably forages both day and night, but mainly diurnally. Recent studies at South Georgia reveal that during incubation period, the sexes use different foraging areas and that these are also independent of those used by either sex of T. chrysostoma, which shows similar level of segregation during this period of life cycle. Feeds extensively on large swarms of krill and attends trawlers for discarded fish and squid. Often feeds in company of other Procellariiformes and other seabirds, including penguins (Eudyptes, Pygoscelis), gulls (Larus) and skuas (Catharacta), and off South Georgia (where this species serves as visual cue to presence of food) it appears to initiate and dominate feeding frenzies at large patches of krill; off Chile steals fish from surfacing shags (Phalacrocorax); sometimes follows cetaceans (Balaena, Globicephala, Lissodelphis, Physeter and Orcinus) and feeding association also noted with Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella).",offal,fishery,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,3232,1.315999698,"CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, Second Edition.

Other data on regional dietary preferences reveal that those birds breeding on Macquarie I have greater similarities to those on Marion I than to those on the Crozets and South Georgia, due to the greater importance of fish and reduced importance of crustaceans at Macquarie; squid species taken were similar at Macquarie and Heard, with a greater proportion of Histioteuthis eltaninae and Martialia hyadesi at the first-named, compensated by greater consumption of Galiteuthis/Teuthowenia spp. at Heard, while species composition at Macquarie differed less in 1970_1993 than between seasons, either due to real stability in diet or to chance sampling during years of similar diet, prey availability or abundance.

Outside breeding season also takes planktonic invertebrates, and has recently begun to exploit sewage outfalls and fishing vessels, and to take other offal in estuaries; wintering birds in California ate squid, fish and shrimps. Many species of fish recorded in diet, but sandeels (Ammodytes), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and herring (Clupea harengus) particularly important; also Gadidae (e.g. Pollachius virens). Nestling diet may differ significantly between breeding colonies according to location: in British Isles, whereas sandeels seem especially important at North Sea colonies, clupeids, especially European sprats (Sprattus sprattus) were predominant food at two Irish colonies during early nestling period. Recent declines in sandeels in NE Atlantic and North Sea have been accompanied by increases there in snake pipefish (Entelurus aequoreus) since about 2003, and the latter have been taken in quantity by kittiwakes and other seabirds, and fed to their nestlings; these rigid fish are hard or impossible to swallow and are in any case of much lower nutritional value than lipid-rich fish species typically consumed. Rarely takes bird eggs. More frequently scavenges offal and carcasses. Sometimes feeds on intertidal molluscs and crustaceans, earthworms and small mammals, and on vegetation, e.g. aquatic plants, potatoes and grain.

Frequent items include small fish, aquatic invertebrates, birdsê eggs and chicks, trawler discards, rodents and berries. Baltic herring (Clupea harengus) are important where available. Breeders tend to forage at sea to a greater extent than other sympatric gulls. However, an inland colony in the Netherlands, 30 km from the coast, appeared to rely entirely on non-marine food, mainly found in refuse dumps, reaching a relatively high breeding success. Birds nesting at Ebro Delta, Spain, select trawler discards but switched to foraging at rubbish dumps and in olive groves and rice fields during a trawling moratorium. In North Sea a recent increase in sea temperature has seen colonization by swimming crabs (Polybius henslowii); these have become an important food source for Lesser Black-backed Gulls during the breeding season and their presence may be a factor in coincident population increases in regional gull colonies. Little or no cannibalism reported but some individuals predatory, taking many ducklings and other small vertebrates. Wintering birds in Europe (races graellsii and intermedius) are increasingly reliant on garbage scavenged at rubbish dumps, which attract large numbers; ricefields in Iberia and elsewhere also attract wintering birds, which forage for crayfish and spilt rice. Other winterers feed at sea in coastal waters and scavenge at fishing ports. Foraging methods include contact-dipping and surface-plunging; nominate race tends to avoid sites frequented by L. marinus, L. argentatus and L. canus, and forages in deeper water, mainly by plunge-diving.

On Laurie I, in South Orkneys, during late incubation and chick-rearing periods, 20 samples revealed that euphausiids were main prey, with Euphausia superba constituting the bulk of the diet, forming 97_2% by mass and 95% by frequency of occurrence, while on King George I, South Shetlands, 60% of samples comprised Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum, as also the case on Ardery I, Windmill Is, Antarctica), with the rest being amphipods (Eusiridae, Lyssianassidae, Calliopidae, Hyperiidea) and Euphausia superba, and some evidence that non-breeders may differ in their diet from those rearing chicks. Tiny sample of stomach contents on Crozet Is were dominated by crustacea (Euphausia vallentini, Thysanoessa, with smaller quantities of Themisto gaudichaudii and Rhincalanus gigas) and fish (sometimes in large numbers). Apparently capable of locating some food by olfaction. Feeds by surface-seizing, pecking busily in pigeon-like manner, especially at krill; also by hydroplaning (see Family Text) and by dipping while on wing; occasionally shallow-plunging and filtering. Feeds both by day and by night, and, at least when feeding on krill, appears to use area-restricted searching, whereby individuals interrupt straight-line motion on detecting prey and then circle about. Often associates with cetaceans (Balaenoptera, Globicephala, Orcinus orca, Physeter) and also with other seabirds, in addition to attending whale carcasses and leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) kills.

In high Arctic, reproduction depends mostly on a single species, the collared lemming (Dichrostonyx groenlandicus; Løppenthin 1943, Maher 1970b, De Korte and Wattel 1988). In low Arctic, other lemmings and voles are also important (Maher 1974c, Andersson Andersson 1976b, Andersson 1981, Portenko 1989). These rodent populations often vary annually by >2 orders of magnitude, with peaks at intervals of 4-5 yr and a year of intermediate rodent abundance often preceding or following a peak (Maher 1974c, Andersson 1976b, De Korte and Wattel 1988, Stenseth and Ims 1993).

Occasionally feeds on carrion (Witherby et al. 1944); attracted to offal used as chum and to ships' waste (D. Lee pers. obs.).
