README: Old project -> new project

Updated taxonomy to HBW 8.1. This makes very few changes, just two species with different spellings, plus an extra 40 species either excluded from the previous analysis or not present
in HBW v 6.
Also removed the scaup as Alex said these should not have been included
This removes plastic study IDs 351 and 352 only.

Data S1 -> plastic-ingestion [update with new plastics data]
Data S2 ocean basins -> ocean-basins [update for each new study added]
Data S2 behavioural and life history data -> trait-data [needs data adding for 40 missing species]
